# Ejector_GPR
OpenAccess sharing of data and GPR code based on research by Knut Emil Ringstad.
Additional materials and codes are supplied as they are completed.

The GPR_predict_flowstructures.py code is run to produce the flow structure mapping and plots.
Surf plots and x-y plots are available. The different pathlines and mixing chamber geometries are variable.

The GPRprocessing.py code trains and predicts the ejector KPIs at different geometries and operating conditions based on the two databases: 
Database_Design_200pnt.csv        - Performance mapping at varied designs
Database_Performance_600pnt.csv                - Performance mapping at varied operating conditions
